Liam’s Project Repository

Welcome to my general repository! This is a collection of all my random projects, experiments, and ideas that I’ve worked on over time. It serves as a hub for everything from small prototypes to more developed projects. Each folder represents a unique idea or initiative, spanning various topics and technologies.

Each project folder contains its own set of files and a README (if applicable) to explain its purpose and functionality.

What’s Inside?

The repository may include:
	•	Coding Projects: Apps, tools, or scripts using various programming languages (Python, JavaScript, etc.).
	•	Hardware Prototypes: Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and other electronics-related projects.
	•	Simulations: Agent-based models, simulations in MATLAB, or other environments.
	•	AI/ML Experiments: Machine learning prototypes and applications.
	•	Web Development: Websites, React apps, or frontend/backend experiments.
	•	Random Ideas: Miscellaneous projects that don’t fit into any specific category but are fun to explore!

Goals of This Repo

This repository serves several purposes:
	1.	Showcase Creativity: A portfolio of ideas and projects that highlight my skills and interests.
	2.	Learning & Experimentation: A playground for trying new tools, technologies, and concepts.
	3.	Reference: A centralized place to revisit older work or gather inspiration for new ideas.

Tools & Technologies

Here’s a list of tools, languages, and platforms commonly used in these projects:
	•	Programming Languages: Python, JavaScript, MATLAB, C++, etc.
	•	Frameworks: Flask, React, Node.js, etc.
	•	Hardware: Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and related electronics.
	•	AI/ML: TensorFlow, OpenCV, Scikit-learn.
	•	Other: 3D modeling (e.g., CAD), simulation software, game development tools, etc.

How to Use
	1.	Browse the repository to find a project of interest.
	2.	Navigate to the project folder and check its specific README (if available) for details.
	3.	If you want to contribute or use any of the code, feel free to fork, clone, or raise issues for questions!

Future Plans
	•	Add detailed READMEs to each project for better understanding.
	•	Organize projects by categories or themes (e.g., AI, simulations, web development).
	•	Continue experimenting and adding new projects regularly.

Contributing

While this repository is primarily for personal use, I’m open to collaborations and feedback! If you find something interesting or want to work on a project together, reach out or submit a pull request.
